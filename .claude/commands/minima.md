Keep in mind we are building full-stack applications. 
A break/fix approach to problem solving isn't always appropriate.  
You might get stuck focussing on "local minimum" or over-index on immediate, obvious problems. 
Sometimes you'll need to step back and think differently or review the process holistically.
